     <h3>Synopsis</h3>
               
            <main class="synopsis">
            <div ><p>pinkface is set in fictional suburban town located in the United States, with influence of East Asian pop culture and media.The story is centered around a teenager named Runa whose biggest insecurity is blushing.  Growing up, her blushing condition wasn’t prominent enough to affect her, but since reaching pubescent years, she noticed that the pink tinge shown in her face made her extremely self-conscious and insecure. The more she thought about this insecurity, the more often it occurred, and eventually it developed a form of social anxiety, hindering her progress in school, and interfering with interpersonal relationships. Before moving again, she wasn’t able to make close friendships or talk to anyone she was attracted to in class. She did not participate in class either, and when called upon without notice, she’d be rendered speechless.</p>
                <br><p>
                She never wanted to appear to be introverted. In fact, internally she always wanted to be social and voice her opinions in many situations. She can’t help but to retract in her shell when her face triggers a rosy flush. Because Runa and her family are moving into a new neighborhood, she sees this as an opportunity to start over and give herself a chance to reborn. Things don’t go as planned, but she learns that even the most unexpected outcomes may happen on the rocky road of adolescence. </p>
